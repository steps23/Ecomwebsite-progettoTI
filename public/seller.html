                Customers can spend less time shopping for what they want. They can easily browse through many 
                items at a time and buy what they like. When online, customers can find items that are available 
                in physical stores far away from them or not found in their locality.
            </li>

                One of the biggest advantages of ecommerce to business that keep sellers 
                interested in online selling is cost reduction. Many sellers have to pay lots 
                to maintain their physical store. They may need to pay extra up front costs like rent, 
                repairs, store design, inventory etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sellers don’t have to spend a lot of money to promote their items. 
                The world of ecommerce has several affordable, quick ways to market online.

                An important advantage of ecommerce to business is that sellers can provide flexibility to customers. 
                One highlight is that the product and services are ready 24x7. 
                The result is that seller can offer his item any place, any time.
            </li>

                A seller with a physical store may only be able to reach a certain number of buyers. They can deliver to 
                the customers’ homes but there can be distance limitations. Several e-commerce marketplaces have their own 
                logistics and delivery system.
